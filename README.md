# Project 1: Weather Data Processor
## Objective: Create a command-line application that processes and displays weather data.
## Instructions:
1.	Data Generation: The application should generate random weather data for different cities. Each data point should include temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
2.	Object-Oriented Design: Implement classes and/or modules to represent different aspects of the weather data (e.g., City, WeatherReport).
3.	Configuration: Use a YAML file to configure the list of cities and any other parameters (like the range of possible temperature values).
4.	Output: The processed data should be displayed in JSON format on the console.
5.	Interactivity: Allow the user to specify a city and date range for which they want to see the weather report.
6.	Documentation: Write clear comments and documentation for your code.
## Evaluation Criteria:
•	Code organization and style.
•	Use of object-oriented principles.
•	Handling of external configuration.
•	Clarity of documentation and comments.
